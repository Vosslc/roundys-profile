## About

Built 100% by Nate Roundy. This web app is to help showcase a bit about myself. There are three main sections. About: which gives the user a brief description about where I came from and who I am. Skills: highlighting all the Technologies I have personaly worked with. Projects: a carousel that displays a img and link to my projects.
