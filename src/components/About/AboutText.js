    about: "I am currently working as a Brewer for CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective and have been here for a year. Before CANarchy I was a Brewer II for Uinta Brewing Company for just under 4 years. I have learned a great deal during my 5 years in the brewing industry, and have had the pleasure of traveling around the states to brew and collaborate with many breweries, some including Oskar Blues, and Cigar City."
